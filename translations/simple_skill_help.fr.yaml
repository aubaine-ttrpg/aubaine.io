    what_is:
      title: "What a Skill is"
      body: "A Skill is a supernatural, exceptional, or specialized capability that provides rules support beyond what anyone could normally attempt. If an action is something \"anyone can try\" (jumping, shoving, basic weapon swing, intimidation speech), it should not require a Skill; it's resolved through normal rolls."
    families:
      title: "Aubaine Skills are designed in two meta-families:"
      unleashed: "Unleashed Skills: flexible, imagination-driven tools (e.g. Kindle the Flames). They are weaker baseline and become competitive through dedicated trees."
      specific: "Specific Skills: focused, efficient effects with clearer outputs (damage/control/mobility). They are stronger baseline and cost efficiency is better."
    resolution:
      title: "How Skills are resolved"
      body: "A Skill lists (explicitly or implicitly via design intent) how it is resolved."
    attack:
      title: "Attack Roll"
      formula: "Attack Roll = d20 + Ability + Aptitude\nvs target AC"
    check:
      title: "Check"
      formula: "Check = d20 + Ability + Aptitude\nvs DC (set by the DM)"
    saving:
      title: "Saving Throw"
      formula: "Skill Save DC = 8 + (caster's Ability) + (caster's chosen Aptitude)"
      body: "Targets do NOT roll the caster's Ability/Aptitude. The Skill must specify what targets roll (e.g. Dexterity + Finesse, Constitution + Discipline, Spirit + Willpower, etc.)."
    rule_of_thumb:
      title: "Rule of thumb:"
      attack: "thrown/directed = Attack Roll"
      saving: "hazards/areas/lingering = Saving Throw"
