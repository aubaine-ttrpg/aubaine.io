# Skills in Aubaine

## What a Skill Is

In **Aubaine**, a **Skill** represents a supernatural, exceptional, or specialized capability that goes beyond what anyone could reasonably attempt through pure improvisation.

If an action is something *anyone could try*—swinging a weapon, jumping a gap, shouting a threat, pushing an object—it does **not** require a Skill. Such actions are resolved through normal rolls, narration, and rulings.

A Skill exists to:

* enable effects that would otherwise be impossible,
* give structure to powerful or repeatable actions,
* support progression, specialization, and character identity.

Skills are the main source of **powers**, **maneuvers**, **spells**, **stances**, and **reactions** in the game.

---

## Two Families of Skills

Although all Skills use the same rules, they fall into two broad design families:

### Unleashed Skills

Unleashed Skills are **flexible, imagination-driven** powers.
They describe *what you can manipulate* rather than *exactly what happens*.

Examples:

* shaping an element,
* manipulating wind, sound, water, slime, energy,
* broad supernatural control.

Unleashed Skills are intentionally **weaker at baseline**, because flexibility is power.
They become competitive through **dedicated Skill Trees** that expand scale, duration, damage thresholds, or special interactions.

### Specific Skills

Specific Skills are **focused and efficient**.
They describe a clear, repeatable effect with defined outputs (damage, control, movement).

Examples:

* Fireball-like effects,
* precise maneuvers,
* named techniques.

Specific Skills are usually **stronger per Energy** than Unleashed Skills, but less adaptable.

---

## Energy

**Energy** is the primary resource used to balance Skills.

* Most Skills cost **0 to 5 Energy**.
* **0 Energy** Skills are utility effects that do not meaningfully swing combat balance.
* Skills that deal damage, apply control, or strongly affect the battlefield generally cost **1 or more Energy**.

Energy represents effort, focus, strain, or power—not only magic.
Martial characters may rely less on Energy; supernatural specialists rely on it more.

---

## When Rolls Are Required

A Skill **does not automatically require a roll**.

Whether a roll is needed depends on **context**:

* **Simple, uncontested uses** succeed automatically.
* **Risky, contested, or impactful uses** may require:

  * an **Attack Roll**,
  * a **Saving Throw**,
  * a **Check**, or
  * an **opposed roll**.

This applies equally to **Actions**, **Reactions**, and creative uses.

The fiction always comes first; the resolution follows.

---

## Skill Resolution

When a roll is required, one of the following is used.

### Attack Roll

Used when a Skill directly targets something offensively.

```
d20 + Ability + Aptitude  vs  AC
```

### Saving Throw

Used when a Skill creates a hazard, area effect, or forced resistance.

```
Save DC = 8 + Ability + Aptitude
```

Targets roll the Saving Throw specified by the Skill (for example Dexterity + Finesse, Constitution + Discipline, Spirit + Willpower).

### Check

Used for non-combat or environmental challenges.

```
d20 + Ability + Aptitude  vs  DC
```

### Opposed Roll

Used when directly contesting another creature’s action (for example reacting to an attack).

```
Your roll  vs  the opposing roll or result
```

---

## Abilities and Aptitudes

A Skill **does not inherently use an Ability or Aptitude** unless a roll, DC, or contested effect is involved.

Some Skills specify:

* an Ability that is **always** used when relevant,
* an Aptitude that depends on **how** the Skill is applied.

Unleashed Skills often allow **any Aptitude**, chosen according to the declared approach.

---

## Reactions

Using a Skill as a **Reaction** does **not** guarantee success.

* The Reaction cost is already significant.
* Depending on context, the effect may:

  * succeed automatically,
  * require an opposed roll,
  * partially mitigate an effect instead of negating it.

Reactions allow characters to **interfere**, not automatically shut down powerful actions.

---

## Duration and Tradeoffs

Many Skills allow **tradeoffs** between damage, duration, scale, and safety.

Common tradeoffs include:

* less damage for longer duration,
* smaller area for higher impact,
* harmless effects lasting longer,
* persistent effects dealing reduced damage.

Unless otherwise stated, durations are capped by what is reasonable for the Skill’s Energy cost.

---

## Damage Bands (Guidelines)

Damage is designed using **bands**, not formulas. These are guidelines for building and balancing Skills.

### Single-Target Damage (Action)

| Energy | Low | Standard | High |
| -----: | --- | -------- | ---- |
|      0 | 1d6 | 1d8      | 1d10 |
|      1 | 2d6 | 2d8      | 2d10 |
|      2 | 3d6 | 3d8      | 3d10 |
|      3 | 4d6 | 4d8      | 4d10 |
|      4 | 5d6 | 5d8      | 5d10 |
|      5 | 6d6 | 6d8      | 6d10 |

### Area Damage

* Standard cap: **8d6**
* Absolute cap: **10d6** (only with strong constraints)

Move down a band when a Skill gains:

* large area,
* long range,
* control riders,
* high reliability,
* persistence.

Move up a band only when a Skill has strong constraints:

* very short range,
* setup requirements,
* self-risk,
* limited uses.

---

## Riders and Balance

A **rider** is any effect added on top of basic damage or utility:

* control,
* forced movement,
* debuffs,
* buffs,
* zones,
* mobility,
* reactions.

Each rider costs **balance units**, paid for by:

* increasing Energy,
* reducing damage,
* shortening range or duration,
* limiting uses,
* requiring saves or opposed rolls,
* adding conditions or drawbacks.

Hard control, multi-target effects, and persistence are especially expensive.

---

## Distance

All distances are written in **meters**.

Common reference distances:

* **1.5 m**: contact
* **3 m**: extended reach
* **4.5 m**: close
* **6 m**: standard
* **9 m**: far

Distances above **9 m** are exceptional and require justification.

---

## Skill Structure

Skills are written using a standardized format.

### Header

* **Code**
* **★** (if Ultimate)
* **Name**
* *(Ability / Aptitude)* — use **None / None** if not inherently tied to stats

### Prerequisites

Requirements to learn or use the Skill:

* Skill Trees,
* minimum Ability or Aptitude,
* other Skills.

### Meta Block

* **Requirements**: speech, gestures, materials, conditions, triggers (if any)
* **Energy**
* **Time**: Action / Bonus Action / Reaction / Passive
* **Range**
* **Duration**

### Description

The Description explains:

* what the Skill allows,
* how it can be used creatively,
* how rolls and tradeoffs are determined,
* examples of use.

Rules are expressed through **clear language**, not exhaustive lists.

### Tags

Tags describe what the Skill *is*, not how it works.
They are used for synergies, trees, and interactions.

Tags are grouped and ordered consistently (type, element, discipline, size, effect, components, etc.).

---

## Ultimates

Ultimates are special Skills marked with **★**.

* Each character has **one Ultimate slot**, separate from Memory.
* Ultimates are **free to equip**.
* Every Ultimate must have a **strong limitation**:

  * limited uses per Long Rest,
  * Ability/Aptitude modifier per Long Rest,
  * special conditions.

Ultimates are powerful, defining moments—not spammable tools.

---

## Design Philosophy

Aubaine Skills are built on three core principles:

1. **Rule of Cool**
   If it’s cool and fits the fiction, the system should support it.

2. **Rule of Customization**
   Skills can be adapted, re-flavored, or slightly altered to fit a character.

3. **Rule of Good Faith**
   Skills are used to enhance fun, not to trap the table in technical debates.

Skills provide structure—not restrictions—for imagination.
Absolutely. Below is a **complete annex pack** that complements the Skills chapter you just approved.
It is **self-contained**, clean, and ready to be dropped into your ruleset.

---

# 1. Canonical Skill Template

```
[CODE] ★ Skill Name (Ability / Aptitude)     ← omit (Ability / Aptitude) if not relevant

```

**Notes**

* Use **None / None** in the header if the Skill does not inherently require stats.
* Rolls are only required when the fiction demands it.
* Reactions allow interference, not guaranteed negation.

---

# 2. Abilities (7)

Abilities represent raw capacities. They are rated from **+0 to +5** (or lower for archetypes).

* **Strength** – raw physical power
* **Dexterity** – coordination, speed, precision
* **Constitution** – endurance, toughness, resistance
* **Intelligence** – reasoning, control, technique, complex manipulation
* **Perception** – physical senses and bodily awareness
* **Charisma** – presence, force of personality, expression
* **Spirit** – mental senses, emotions, extrasensory and spiritual perception

**Rule**

> Abilities are only used when a roll, DC, or contest is involved.

---

# 3. Aptitudes (24)

Aptitudes describe *how* an action is performed.
They usually range from **–1 to +6**.

**Physical / Combat**

* Athletics
* Acrobatics
* Stealth
* Discipline
* Finesse
* Melee
* Aim

**Social / Mental**

* Persuasion
* Deception
* Performance
* Intimidation
* Intuition
* Willpower

**Knowledge / Exploration**

* Investigation
* History
* Culture
* Religion
* Medicine

**Nature / Technical**

* Nature
* Survival
* Animal Handling
* Technology
* Craft

**Rule**

> The Aptitude used depends on the declared approach, not the Skill name.

Unleashed Skills often allow **any Aptitude**, chosen contextually.

---

# 4. Targeting Language Annex

Use these phrases directly in Skill descriptions.

### Core Targets

* one creature
* one object
* one creature or object
* all creatures
* all enemy creatures
* all allied creatures
* all creatures and objects
* all other creatures
* creatures of your choice

### Conditional Targeting

* up to X creatures
* each creature that enters the area
* creatures hit by the attack
* creatures that fail the Saving Throw
* unattended objects
* objects worn or carried

### Exclusions

* except you
* except allied creatures
* unaffected by this Skill

**Rule**

> Use clear language, not tags, to define who is affected.

---

# 5. Distance Reference Annex

All distances are expressed in **meters**.

Common reference values:

* **1.5 m** – contact
* **3 m** – extended reach
* **4.5 m** – close distance
* **6 m** – standard distance
* **9 m** – far distance

Distances above **9 m** are exceptional and require justification.

Areas use the same values:

* radius 1.5 / 3 / 4.5 m
* lines 6 / 9 m

**Rounding**

> Always round up.

---

# 6. Roll & Resolution Quick Annex

### Attack Roll

```
d20 + Ability + Aptitude  vs  AC
```

### Saving Throw

```
Save DC = 8 + Ability + Aptitude
```

Targets roll the Saving Throw specified by the Skill.

### Check

```
d20 + Ability + Aptitude  vs  DC
```

### Opposed Roll

```
Your roll  vs  opposing roll or result
```

**Core Rule**

> Simple or uncontested uses succeed automatically.
> Risky, contested, or impactful uses require rolls.

This applies to **Actions and Reactions**.

---

# 7. Ultimate Annex

### What an Ultimate Is

An **Ultimate** is a defining Skill marked with **★**.

### Ultimate Slot

* Each character has **one Ultimate slot**
* It does **not** use Memory slots
* Ultimates are free to equip

### Limitation (mandatory)

Every Ultimate must have a strong limiter:

* X uses per Long Rest
* Ability or Aptitude modifier per Long Rest
* Special condition

### Design Intent

Ultimates are:

* powerful
* cinematic
* rare

They are not part of normal rotation.

---

## Final Note (system-facing)

Aubaine Skills are designed to:

* enable imagination,
* structure power progression,
* and resolve uncertainty only when necessary.

Skills are **tools**, not permissions.

---

# Annex — Tags 

## What Tags Are

In **Aubaine**, **Tags are evocative identifiers** that express the **core identity** of a Skill.

They are not exhaustive descriptors.
They exist to support:

* Skill Tree synergies
* prerequisites and upgrades
* filtering and search
* future system expansion

A Skill should usually have **3 to 5 tags maximum**.

---

## Tag Writing Rules (Locked)

* Tags are written as **plain, capitalized words**
* Separated by commas
* No ALL CAPS
* No symbols, arrows, or prefixes

**Correct**

```
Spell, Fire, Evocation, Somatic
```

**Incorrect**

```
SPELL, FIRE
Spell → Fire → Evocation
Spell / Fire / Evocation
```

---

## Tag Weight System (Designer Rule)

Each tag belongs to a **category with a weight**.
Weights are **not shown to players**, but enforce **ordering and consistency**.

Tags are always written in **ascending weight order**, then alphabetically within the same weight.

---

## Canonical Tag Categories & Weights

### Skill Nature — **Weight 10**

What kind of Skill it is.

* Spell
* Maneuver
* Shout
* Stance
* Reaction
* Ritual
* Passive

Only **one** of these should appear on a Skill.

---

### Element / Theme — **Weight 20**

The dominant element or thematic source.

* Fire
* Water
* Wind
* Lightning
* Earth
* Slime
* Ice
* Poison
* Acid
* Shadow
* Holy
* Arcane
* Nature

Use **only if central** to the Skill’s identity.

---

### Arcane Schools — **Weight 30**

How magical power is structured or expressed.

* Evocation
* Illusion
* Transmutation
* Conjuration
* Abjuration
* Divination
* Enchantment

Only include an Arcane School if the Skill is **explicitly magical**.

---

### Martial Disciplines — **Weight 31**

Physical or combat traditions.

* Swordplay
* Archery
* Brawling
* Stealth
* Tactics
* Guard
* Duel

Only include if the Skill is **defined by the discipline**, not merely compatible with it.

---

### Crafting Traditions — **Weight 32**

Technical or artisanal origins.

* Alchemy
* Engineering
* Runes
* Artifice
* Smithing

Used sparingly; most Skills do not need these.

---

### Special Effects — **Weight 50**

Used **only when the main purpose of the Skill is the effect itself**.

* Buff
* Debuff
* Heal
* Control

Do **not** tag Damage, Utility, Movement, Area, or Shape.

---

### Other / Narrative — **Weight 999**

Highly specific or narrative tags.

* Totem
* Bloodline:Drake
* Ancestral
* Relic
* Cursed

Use **only when required by fiction**.

---

## Tag Limits & Governance

* **Maximum recommended tags:** 5
* If a Skill needs more, it is being over-described
* Tags must be added to the **global list** before use
* Tags never imply power level

> **Design rule:**
> If removing a tag does not change how the Skill is *understood*, that tag should not exist.

---

## Example (Correct)

**Kindle the Flames**

```
Spell, Fire, Evocation, Somatic
```

This tells you:

* it is a spell
* about fire
* expressed through evocation
* requires gestures

Nothing more is needed.

---

## Explicitly Removed Tag Types

These do **not exist** in Aubaine tagging:

* ❌ Size / Shape (Cone, Line, Area, Aura, etc.)
* ❌ Targeting (Monotarget, Multi-target, etc.)
* ❌ Generic effects (Damage, Utility, Movement)
* ❌ Components: Material, Focus

All of that belongs in the **Description**, not in tags.

---

## Final Design Principle

> Tags should be **memorable, sparse, and identity-defining**.

If a player remembers a Skill, its tags should feel obvious — not technical.

---

Great point. This is exactly the kind of thing that *prevents rules-lawyering and bad Skills later*.
Below is a **clean, system-facing annex** explaining **how Skill descriptions are written**, D&D-style but adapted to Aubaine’s philosophy.

You can drop this straight into the book after the Skill template.

---

# Annex — Writing Skill Descriptions

## General Principle

A Skill’s **Description** is the authoritative text.

* It explains **what the Skill allows**, not every possible outcome.
* It defines **limits, tradeoffs, and intent**, not edge cases.
* It should be readable **out loud at the table**.

If something matters mechanically, it must appear in the Description.
If something is obvious from fiction, it does not need rules text.

---

## Paragraph Structure (Locked)

Skill descriptions in Aubaine are written in **clear paragraphs**, not bullet points.

Most Skills should follow this structure:

### Paragraph 1 — Principle & Scope

The first paragraph explains:

* what the Skill fundamentally does,
* what can be manipulated, created, or affected,
* the **baseline limits** (scale, duration, scope),
* that resolution depends on context.

This paragraph establishes the **mental model** of the Skill.

**Unleashed Skills** always use this paragraph to state:

* that Aptitude, damage, duration, and resolution depend on intent,
* that rolls may or may not be required depending on context.

---

### Paragraph 2 — Offensive / Impactful Use

The second paragraph explains:

* how the Skill is resolved when used offensively or forcefully,
* default damage values (if any),
* which Ability is used when rolls or DCs apply,
* how Aptitudes are chosen based on approach,
* how Saving Throws or contested effects work.

This paragraph only exists if the Skill can meaningfully affect others.

---

### Paragraph 3 — Reactions (If Applicable)

The third paragraph explains:

* how the Skill can be used as a Reaction,
* that Reactions do **not** guarantee success,
* when opposed rolls or partial mitigation apply,
* examples of interference, not negation.

If the Skill cannot be used as a Reaction, omit this paragraph entirely.

---

## Tone & Style Rules

### Use Natural Language

Descriptions should read like rules, not like code.

Prefer:

> “You create, move, or reshape…”

Avoid:

> “The user may instantiate…”

---

### Avoid Exhaustive Lists

Do **not** try to list every possible use.

Use **examples**, not catalogs.

Correct:

> “For example, you might…”

Incorrect:

> “This Skill can be used to do A, B, C, D, E…”

Examples guide imagination without limiting it.

---

### No Hidden Rules

Do not rely on tags or assumptions for mechanics.

If a Skill:

* sets a Saving Throw,
* uses an opposed roll,
* trades damage for duration,

…it must be stated explicitly in the Description.

---

### No Redundant Rules

Do not restate core rules.

Avoid:

* re-explaining what an Attack Roll is,
* re-defining Energy,
* re-listing distance conventions.

Assume the reader knows the system basics.

---

## Rolls & Resolution Wording

Use **conditional language**, not absolutes.

Preferred wording:

* “Depending on the context…”
* “This may require a roll…”
* “If the action is contested…”

Avoid:

* “Always”
* “Never”
* “Automatically succeeds” (unless explicitly intended)

This keeps the system flexible and DM-friendly.

---

## Examples Are Canon, Not Limits

When a Skill gives examples, they are:

* **illustrative**, not exhaustive,
* valid use-cases,
* not exclusive permissions.

Always imply:

> “These are examples, not limits.”

This is especially important for Unleashed Skills.

---

## What Not to Put in Descriptions

Do not include:

* tag explanations,
* balance math,
* designer intent,
* meta commentary,
* references to other chapters.

The Description exists **only** to explain what happens in play.

---

## Readability Rule

Before finalizing a Skill, ask:

> “Can a player understand what this does after one read, without asking the DM?”

If the answer is no:

* simplify the language,
* split sentences,
* reduce abstraction.

---

## Design Guideline (One Sentence Rule)

> A good Skill description tells players what they can *try*, tells the GM how to *resolve uncertainty*, and stays silent when nothing is at stake.

---

# Annex — Default Skill Assumptions

Unless stated otherwise in a Skill’s Description:
- A Skill affects only what is explicitly described.
- A Skill does not bypass immunities, resistances, or protections.
- A Skill does not stack with itself.
- A Skill does not permanently alter the environment.
- A Skill does not negate another effect outright unless explicitly stated.
- A Skill used as a Reaction interferes rather than automatically cancels.
- A Skill does not require concentration unless stated.
- A Skill does not scale with level unless modified by a Skill Tree or upgrade.

# Unleashed Skill Baseline

Unleashed Skills:
- are intentionally flexible but conservative at baseline,
- trade raw efficiency for adaptability,
- should be weaker than Specific Skills when used straightforwardly,
- become competitive through specialization trees and upgrades.
- If an Unleashed Skill seems weaker than a focused alternative, this is intentional.

# Skill Creation Checklist

Before finalizing a Skill, verify:

- Does this Skill enable something that could not be done reliably without it?
- Is the Energy cost appropriate for its best-case impact, not its average use?
- Are damage, duration, and scale using existing bands, not invented values?
- Are tradeoffs explicit when flexibility or persistence is granted?
- Are rolls only required when something is contested or meaningful?
- Are Reactions framed as interference, not automatic negation?
- Does the Skill have 3–5 evocative tags maximum?
- Would removing any tag make the Skill less understandable?
- Can a player understand the Skill after one read?

If any answer is “no”, revise the Skill.

---

## Annex — Display Rules (New)

**Omit empty fields.**
If a field is empty, “None”, “0”, or otherwise irrelevant, **do not display it** on the Skill entry.

Examples:

* If Energy is **0**, do not show an Energy line at all.
* If a Skill has no fixed stats, omit *(Ability / Aptitude)* entirely (don’t print *(None / None)*).
* If Requirements are none, omit the Requirements line.
* If Limitations are none, omit the Limitations line.
* If Range or Duration are “Instantaneous” by nature and not important, you may omit them (optional), but be consistent.

This keeps Skills readable and prevents meta clutter.

---

## Tags annex update (Mandatory / Optional tags)

### Mandatory tag rule (Locked)

* **The first tag (Skill Type) is mandatory.**
* All other tags are optional and should be used only if they are **evocative and central** to the Skill’s identity.
* A Skill may have **only one tag** (its type).

### Default type tag

Add this to the Skill Type list:

* **Technique** *(default placeholder type for Skills that aren’t clearly Spell, Maneuver, Shout, Stance, Reaction, Ritual, Passive, etc.)*

So the minimum valid tag set is:

* `Technique`

Examples:

* `Technique`
* `Spell, Fire`
* `Maneuver, Swordplay`
* `Stance`
* `Reaction, Wind`

(Still keep the max-5 tags guideline.)

---

## Meta block update: add **Limitations** (DnD-like, inside meta)

Update your canonical template meta block to:

**Limitations:** *(omit if none)*
**Requirements:** *(omit if none)*
**Energy:** X *(omit if 0)*
**Time:** …
**Range:** Xm
**Duration:** …

Limitations examples:

* Once per Short Rest
* Twice per Long Rest
* Arcana modifier per Long Rest
* Only while at 0 Energy
* Once per target per Long Rest

This is the “cooldown economy” equivalent and should be standardized.

---

## Core rules note: don’t restate status restrictions

Add a short rule to the Skills chapter (or Default Assumptions annex):

> **A Skill never needs to state basic gameplay constraints** already handled by the system, such as being unable to act while incapacitated, unconscious, restrained by a status, etc. Those limitations are governed by **statuses** and core action rules, not Skill text.

This prevents bloat like “you must be able to move / you can’t be incapacitated” appearing everywhere.

---

## Annex — Writing Conventions (Addendum)

### Narrative Voice (Mandatory)

All Skill descriptions must be written using **second-person, formal address**.

* In English: **“you”**
* In French: **“vous”**

This applies to **all descriptions**, without exception.

Correct (French):

> *Vous créez, déplacez ou absorbez…*

Incorrect:

> *Le personnage crée…*
> *On peut créer…*
> *Le sort permet de…*

This keeps descriptions:

* consistent,
* readable aloud,
* aligned with established RPG conventions (D&D-style).

---

### No Bullet Points (Absolute Rule)

**Bullet points are never used in Skill descriptions.**

* No lists
* No sublists
* No numbered steps
* No hyphenated effects

All Skill effects must be written in **full sentences and paragraphs**.

Examples, conditions, and alternatives are expressed through **natural language**, not formatting.

Correct:

> *Par exemple, vous pouvez détourner une flamme, atténuer une brûlure ou créer une distraction lumineuse.*

Incorrect:

> • détourner une flamme
> • atténuer une brûlure
> • créer une distraction

This rule applies **only to Skill descriptions**.
Bullet points may still be used elsewhere in the rules (annexes, summaries, tables, guidelines).

---

### Why this rule exists

* Prevents technical, “ability-card” writing
* Forces authors to think in **fiction-first terms**
* Avoids exhaustive lists that kill creativity
* Keeps Skills readable, evocative, and human

## Final Writing Principle (One Sentence)

> **A Skill description in Aubaine is written as rules-informed prose, addressed directly to “vous”, and never as a checklist.**

---

# Annex — Writing & Terminology Conventions (Final Addendum)

## Address & Style (Reminder)

All Skill descriptions are written:

* in **second person**,
* using **formal address**.

In French, **always use “vous”**.
This rule has **no exception**.

---

## Formatting Rule (Reminder)

**Bullet points are never used** in Skill descriptions.

All effects, examples, conditions, and clarifications are written in **full sentences and paragraphs**.

---

## Requirements vs Tags (Updated Rule)

**Somatic** and **Verbal** are **not Tags**.

They are expressed exclusively through **Requirements**, using natural language.

Examples:

* **Parole**
* **Au moins une main de libre**
* **Deux mains libres**
* **Contact visuel requis**
* **Un objet inflammable à portée**

Requirements describe **what must be true to use the Skill**, not what the Skill is.

---

## Logical Operators in Requirements & Prerequisites

When logical conditions are used, **AND / OR must always be written in ALL CAPS**.

This applies to:

* Requirements
* Prerequisites
* Limitations

Examples:

* **Parole ET Au moins une main de libre**
* **Intelligence ≥ 3 OU Arcane ≥ 3**
* **Charisme ≥ 3 OU Intimidation ≥ 2**
* **Magicien (Arbre) OU Pyromancien (Arbre)**

This makes conditions:

* immediately readable,
* unambiguous,
* visually distinct from prose.

---

## Capitalization of Technical Terms (Mandatory)

All **technical game terms** must always be capitalized in Skill descriptions.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* **Jet d’Attaque**
* **Jet de Sauvegarde**
* **Jet de Caractéristique**
* **Jet Opposé**
* **DD**
* **Action**, **Action Bonus**, **Réaction**
* **Énergie**
* **Portée**
* **Durée**
* **Statut** names (e.g. **Brûlé**, **Entravé**, **Incapacité**, etc.)

If a word refers to a **defined rule, mechanic, or status**, it must be capitalized.

This visually signals:

* “this is a rule concept”,
* not just narrative text.

---

## Statuses Are System-Level (No Restatement)

Skills **never restate** basic system restrictions such as:

* being unable to act while **Incapacité**,
* being unable to move due to a **Statut**,
* action economy limits.

Those are handled by **Statuses and core rules**, not Skill text.

If a Skill breaks a rule, it must say so explicitly.

---

## Tag System Clarification (Reminder)

* Only the **first tag (Skill Type)** is mandatory.
* All other tags are optional and must be **evocative**.
* A Skill may have **only one tag**, typically **Technique**, if nothing else is central.

Examples:

* `Technique`
* `Spell, Fire`
* `Maneuver, Swordplay`

Tags never include:

* components,
* shapes,
* targeting,
* generic effects.
